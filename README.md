## About The Project

This is a test suite for conformance tests of the ISiK specification modules, for Stufe 5:

- [Stufe 5](https://simplifier.net/isik-stufe-5/~guides)

As default, Tests will be executed for the Stufe 5 of the specification.

### Release Notes

See [ReleaseNotes.md](./ReleaseNotes.md) for all information regarding the (newest) releases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the test suite you need the following components:

1. This test suite, which you can get either by cloning this repository or downloading the latest release.
    - If you want to run the test suite using Maven, you need to have `Java 17` and `Maven` installed on your machine.
      If you are behind a proxy, please make sure to configure the proxy settings for Java and Maven.
    - If you want to run the test suite using Docker, you need to have `Docker` and `Docker Compose` installed on your
      machine. If you are behind a proxy, please make sure to configure the proxy settings accordingly.
2. An ISiK resource server (System under Test, SUT) that is compliant with one of the ISiK Stufe specification modules.

Operating system requirements:
cf. [Tiger Framework OS requirements](https://gematik.github.io/app-Tiger/Tiger-User-Manual.html#_requirements)

### Installation

#### Test environment

Configure the endpoint of the SUT using the configuration element `servers.fhirserver.source` in the
`tiger-isik-stufe5.yaml`
configuration file. Example:

```yaml
servers:
  #...   
  fhirserver:
    type: externalUrl
    source:
      - http://localhost:9032
```

See examples for different configuration options in the [tiger.yaml for ISIK Stufe 5](tiger-isik-stufe5.yaml) or check
the official [Tiger documentation](https://gematik.github.io/app-Tiger/Tiger-User-Manual.html)

#### Test resources

Each test case requires specific test resources to be present in the SUT. Create the following test resources in the SUT
and put their corresponding IDs into the `testdata/MODULENAME.yaml` configuration file.

Example:

The `@Patient-Read` test case requires a patient resource to be created in the SUT by the user before the test case can
be run. As the SUT would usually assign a new unique ID to each created resource, e.g.
`244b0d72-fe47-4294-be48-7763895287c5`, this newly assigned ID should be put into the `testdata/basis.yaml`
configuration file. The precondition of the test case declares which configuration variable should be used -
`patient-read-id` in this example:

```yaml
...
patient-read-id: Patient-Read-Example
...
```

#### Test Selection

By default, all the mandatory tests for ISiK Level 5 are executed when running the testsuite. In Maven, this is achieved
by activating the `stufe5` profile, which is also the default when running the testsuite with Docker.

If you want to alternative tests to run, please refer to
the [Cucumber documentation](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#tag-expressions) for more information about tag
expressions.

Currently supported tags are:

| Tag                    | Description                                                                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Stufe5`              | Runs all tests for Stufe 5 of the specification.                                                           |
| `@Optional`            | Runs all tests that are marked as optional in the specification. By default, these tests are not executed. |
| `@Basis`               | Runs all the tests from the **Basis** Module                                                               |
| `@Terminplanung`       | Runs all the tests from the **Terminplanung** Module                                                       |
| `@Medikation`          | Runs all the tests from the **Medikation** Module                                                          |
| `@Vitalparameter`      | Runs all the tests from the **Vitalparameter** Module                                                      |
| `@Dokumentenaustausch` | Runs all the tests from the **Dokumentenaustausch** Module                                                 |
| `@Connect`             | Runs all the tests from the **Connect** Module                                                             |
| `@ICUMinimal`          | Runs all the tests from the **ICU** Module, with minimal support                                           |
| `@ICUExtended`         | Runs all the tests from the **ICU** Module, with extended support                                          |

## Usage

### Running against a THP Docker stack

The standalone runner executes the **Connect**, **Basis Patient Read**, and
**Patient Update/Delete Cancellation** selections (39 scenarios in the current
suite). It requires Python 3.10+, Java 21, Maven, and a running, seeded THP box:

```sh
python3 scripts/run_thp_tests.py
```

The default endpoint is `http://localhost:8080`, with Keycloak at `/auth`, realm
`thp`, and the box's demo credentials. The runner discovers the FHIR links of
`patient-1`, `patient-2`, and `practitioner-1`; obtain a seeded box by completing its
`fhir-init` setup first. No archived reports, old tokens, fixed resource IDs, pip
packages, or other Python scripts are needed.

The runner creates temporary Keycloak clients, obtains fresh tokens with the exact
Connect scopes, and creates disposable Basis patients. It removes its clients and
patients afterward, including after test failures; seeded users and their resources
are not changed. Missing read scopes are created temporarily and removed afterward;
existing scopes are preserved. Use `--require-existing-scopes` to prohibit scope
creation, or `--keep-fixtures` to retain created patients for debugging.

```sh
# Another local port
python3 scripts/run_thp_tests.py --base-url http://localhost:8090
# Only one selection
python3 scripts/run_thp_tests.py --tests patient-read
# Optionally start a box using its Compose file and existing project name
python3 scripts/run_thp_tests.py --compose-file /path/to/docker-compose.yml --compose-project secured
```

Override passwords through `THP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (default `admin`),
`THP_SYSTEM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `THP_PATIENT_PASSWORD`, and `THP_PRACTITIONER_PASSWORD`
(default `password`). `--help` lists endpoint, identity, timeout, and output options.
The script runs on macOS/Linux and defaults to Tiger **4.4.3**, matching the verified
THP execution; change it with `--tiger-version` if needed.

Every invocation writes a new `.test-reports/thp/<run-id>/index.html`, with totals
from Maven Failsafe, links to each native Tiger/Serenity report, logs, configuration,
and `summary.json`. Report files include HTTP authentication tokens and are created
with private permissions. Later selections continue after test failures. Exit codes
are **0** for success, **1** for test failures/errors, **2** for setup/build/cleanup
problems, and **130** for interruption. The verified local THP baseline has four
Connect failures, so exit 1 is expected until those behaviors change.

### Using Maven

You can run the test suite by defining the specification level and the tests to run using the `TESTS_TO_RUN` property.

Example:

```sh
# Run all mandatory tests for Stufe 3 (default)
mvn clean verify
# Run all mandatory tests for Stufe 5
mvn clean verify -Pstufe5
# Run only the Terminplanung tests for Stufe 5
mvn clean verify -Pstufe5 -DTESTS_TO_RUN="@Stufe5 and @Terminplanung"
```

#### Proxy settings

If using the tiger testsuite behind a proxy provide the proxy configuration at the following places:

1. Maven configuration ([official documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html).
2. `tiger-isik-stufe5.yaml` (`forwardToProxy` configuration block)

### Using Docker

The testsuite is also distributed as a [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gematik1/isik-testsuite) and can be
instrumented using Docker Compose. Make sure that the Docker environment has a connection to the System-Under-Test
(configure [docker proxy settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/cli/proxy/) if needed).

To use the image, download and adjust the following files according to your test environment:

* `tiger-isik-stufe3.yaml` or `tiger-isik-stufe5.yaml` (configuration of the test environment and test framework)
* `dc-testsuite.yml` (configuration of the docker container)
* `testdata/*.yaml` (configuration of test data per module)

#### Configuring Test Execution

The Test Suite runs environment variables to control which tests are executed. You can configure these in the
`dc-testsuite.yml` file or pass them directly:

| Variable        | Description                          | Default                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `MAVEN_PROFILE` | Maven profile to activate (`stufe5`) | `stufe5`                      |
| `TESTS_TO_RUN`  | Cucumber tags to filter test cases   | `@Stufe5 and (not @Optional)` |

Example:

```yaml
# Select the Stufe 5 tests and only run the tests from the Terminplanung module
environment:
  - MAVEN_PROFILE=stufe5
  - TESTS_TO_RUN="@Stufe5 and @Terminplanung"
```

In the Folder `testdata/` you can configure the information required by the execution of the test cases. Each test case
comes with some preconditions and description of what should be provided by the user of this testsuite, e.g. the
configuration of IDs of FHIR Resources for the System under Test.

**IMPORTANT** For the `Connect` Module, the tests make the assumption that the System-Under-Test is up and running and
that an Authorization Server is available. The tests do not evaluate the SMART-on-FHIR Authorization Flow, instead they
require the Bearer Token used for sending authenticated requests to the System-Under-Test (or Resource Server).

#### Running Tests

Once all the configurations are done, you can start the test suite using the following command:

```sh
docker compose --project-name isik-testsuite -f dc-testsuite.yml up
```

For Docker, the Test Results will be stored in a Docker Volume, name `tiger-testsuite-report`. To access the results,
you can copy them from the Docker Volume to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm -v tiger-testsuite-report:/report -v $(pwd):/local busybox cp /report/* /local/
```

## Inspecting test results

Right after starting a test suite a browser window will open, which provides an overview of the testing progress. If
using Tiger in Docker, please navigate to http://localhost:9011 manually.
See [Tiger Workflow UI](https://gematik.github.io/app-Tiger/Tiger-User-Manual.html#_tiger_user_interfaces) for further
information about the user interface. To run the test suite without the GUI, e.g. within a CI/CD pipeline, set the
configuration element `lib.activateWorkflowUi` to `false` in the `tiger-isik-stufe5.yaml`
configuration file.

After the test suite finishes the archived test results can be found in `debug-report.zip` file (take notice of the
`debug-report` suffix) or `target/site/serenity/index.html` in case of a Maven run.

> **Warning**
> Each test run deletes the reports of the previous run. Backup the created reports if you need them in the future.

## Submitting test results as part of the ISiK certification process

The artifact  `target/test-report.zip` is required to apply for
the [ISiK conformance certificate](https://fachportal.gematik.de/informationen-fuer/isik/bestaetigungsverfahren-isik)
(take notice of the `test-report` suffix).
Please [get an account](https://fachportal.gematik.de/gematik-onlineshop/titus?ai%5Baction%5D=detail&ai%5Bcontroller%5D=Catalog&ai%5Bd_name%5D=111&ai%5Bd_pos%5D=2)
to the TITUS platform and upload the report into the corresponding submission form.

> **Warning**
> Each test run deletes the reports of the previous run. Backup the created reports if you need them in the future.
